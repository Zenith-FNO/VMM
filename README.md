# Zenith
## Virtual Market Maker

Zenith is the first perpetual future and options exchange on the Tezos blockchain. It provides users to go long or short on perpetual of your favorite assets with up to 10x leverage in all market conditions. Zenith has non-expiry future contracts allowing traders to speculate on the price movement of an underlying asset without actual ownership of the underlying asset, by buying (long) or selling (short) the contract and also incentivizing traders with funding mechanisms. We offer 100% on-chain and non-custodial trading. Zenith uses stable coins for future trading instead of any other token pairs as it results in less exposure to the volatility of those tokens. For this, we use the advanced version of VMM instead of AMM. We also have a high-performance and peer-to-peer options trading platform. You can buy and sell options of your favorite crypto assets with low fees, deep liquidity, and accurate pricing, secured by Tezos.
